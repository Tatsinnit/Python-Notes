# Python-Notes
*(Python notes, as I flirt with this amazing language)*

### Intro 101 Notes

I am currently flirting with this programming language and understanding how types and flow is handled in this language, my initial take is the ease and thoughtfulness this language is designed for. It does sound like perfect agile programming language[3].

Here's the working list for what I'm calling agile programming languages. [3]


•	excellent for beginners, yet superb for experts 

•	highly scalable, suitable for large projects as well as small ones 

•	rapid development 

•	portable, cross-platform 

•	embeddable 

•	easily extensible 

•	object-oriented 

•	you can get the job done 

•	simple yet elegant 

•	stable and mature 

•	powerful standard libs 

•	wealth of 3rd party packages

First let us place Python programming in the context of the computer hardware. At the most fundamental level in the computer there are instructions built into the hardware. These are very simple instructions, peculiar to the hardware of your particular type of computer. The instructions are designed to be simple for the hardware to execute, not for humans to follow. The earliest programming was done with such instructions. If was difﬁcult and error-prone. A major advance was the development of higher-level languages and translators for them. Higher-level languages allow computer programmers to write instructions in a format that is easier for humans to understand. For example:

 z = x+y - is an instruction in many high-level languages that means something like: 

1. Access the value stored at a location labeled x 

2. Calculate the sum of this value and the value stored at a location labeled y 

3. Store the result in a location labeled z. 

No computer understands the high-level instruction directly; it is not in machine language. A special program must ﬁrst translate instructions like this one into machine language. This one high-level instruction might be translated into a sequence of three machine language instructions corresponding to the three step description above:

0000010010000001 

0000000010000010 

0000010110000011

Obviously high-level languages were a great advance in clarity!

## Why python?	

Few best reasons: http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/what_is_python.html 

"Python is an open-source object-oriented programming language that offers two to ten fold programmer productivity increases over languages like C, C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic (VB), and Perl."

“This was my most dramatic Python moment. But, when all is said and done, it was just a clever hack. The long-term usefulness of a language comes not in its ability to support clever hacks, but from how well and how unobtrusively it supports the day-to-day work of programming. The day-to-day work of programming consists not of writing new programs, but mostly reading and modifying existing ones.”

## Installation:

If you have chocolatey package manager: https://chocolatey.org/ installed then then you can simple call “Choco install python”. (https://chocolatey.org/packages/python)

First program
From console type “Python”

```
